Hello, I'm Carter McAlister. I'm a Software Engineer from Texas.

I am a full-stack developer with a particular interest in building fast, scalable, accessible front-ends. Currently, I am a Core Contributor to [Alliance DAO](https://alliance.xyz) while traveling around the United States with my fianc√©e Jess.

When I'm not writing code, I love spending time outdoors - EUCing, hiking, skiing, mountain biking, and scuba diving.
