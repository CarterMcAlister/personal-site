title: "Who Am I?"

Hello, I'm Carter McAlister. I'm a Software Engineer from Texas. I had a passion for coding from a young age, and launched my first website at 12. After graduating High School, I started working as a freelance developer.

These days I specialize in front-end development using web technologies. Currently, I am working remotely for [Rocketmiles](https://www.rocketmiles.com) while traveling around the United States with my girlfriend Jess.

When I'm not writing code, I love spending time outdoors - hiking, skiing, mountain biking, and scuba diving.
