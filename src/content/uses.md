Here is an overview of the hardware and software that I use. I am constantly refining my setup, so this page will serve as a living document.

###Primary Editor

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my favorite editor.
- I use the [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles) font along with the [Material Theme Italicize](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Serge.vsc-material-theme-italicize) theme.

###Editor Extensions

- I use [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) to keep my VS Code extensions backed up to Github, which is very useful when setting up a new machine. You can see my Settings Sync file with all of the extensions I use [here](https://gist.github.com/CarterMcAlister/a7c38abcacddf0137da259181ca2f7df).
- [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) gives bracket pairs unique colors and makes it easier to follow code structure at a glance.
- I use [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) to highlight different types of comments.
- Debugger for [Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) and [Firefox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firefox-devtools.vscode-firefox-debug) are helpful when debugging.
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) adds powerful Git features to VS Code. The line by line blame annotations are very useful.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is a great code formatter, and easy to configure.
- [Turbo Console Log](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log) is great for quickly adding informative comments when debugging with logging.

###Software

- I use [Brave](https://www.brave.com) as my main browser for all the goodness of Chrome with the addition of ad and tracker blocking, along with [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) for testing and the excellent CSS tools.
- I use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) for the plugins and workflows.
- I use [Slack](https://www.slack.com) and [Telegram](https://www.telegram.org) for communication.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) does everything I need from a design tool, and it's free for hobbyist use.
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) has recently became my music application of choice.
- While I'm comfortable with using Git from the command line, I use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) (for more advanced operations) as I prefer to use a GUI.
- When I'm working on Backend code, I use [Intellj IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [Datagrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) for my database work.
- I use the [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) suite for any image or video editing work I do.
- I use [Paste](https://pasteapp.me/) for searchable clipboard history, and accessing text/code snippets that I often reuse, I highly recommend this.
- I use [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) for managing my windows.
- I use [Karabiner-Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) for remapping my Magic Keyboard eject key to a forward delete key, and for allowing me to open the VS Code file search menu by double-tapping shift.

###Terminal

- I use the built-in VS Code terminal for simple operations, but for anything more I use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) with a zsh shell.
- I use the [Powerlevel10k](placeholder) theme, it is very flexible and much faster than alternatives.
- I use [Z](placeholder) to quickly jump between project folders.
- I use [zplugin](placeholder) to manage my ZSH plugins.

###Hardware

- My main development machine is a [MacBook Pro 15" with Touchbar](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-pro-15-4-display-with-touch-bar-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-amd-radeon-pro-555x-256gb-ssd-silver/4600301.p). This is a heretical opinion, but I am actually a fan of both the touchbar _and_ the butterfly keyboard.
- I use an [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Keyboard-Wireless-Rechargable-English/dp/B016QO64FI) for its compact size, battery life, and lack of a numpad.
- I use a [MX Master](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-master-3) mouse because I love the dynamic scroll wheel and side scrolling wheel.
- My monitor is a [Dell Ultrasharp 27" 4k](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-Ultrasharp-U2718Q-27-Inch-Monitor/dp/B073VYVX5S/ref=sr_1_2), it has great image quality and colors for the price.
- My headphones are currently [Samsung Galaxy Buds](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/headphones/galaxy-buds--white-sm-r170nzwaxar/) which are great for convenience, but I am on the hunt for something better suited to use for video calls.

###Other Gear

I am currently traveling the US while working so while I don't have any desk or chair recommendations for you, I do have other gear that I carry with me.

- I use and highly recommend the [Nexstand Laptop Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Nexstand-Laptop-Stand-Portable-MacBook/dp/B01HHYQBB8/ref=sr_1_1_sspa). It securely holds my laptop while in use, and collapses nicely for carrying in my bag.
- I carry my MacBook in a [Leather Casion Sleeve](https://www.amazon.com/CAISON-Genuine-Leather-Special-2016-2019/dp/B07QKQLW9L/ref=sr_1_5).
- My daily driver and carry on bag is a [GoRuck GR1](https://www.goruck.com/gr1/). It's a little pricey for a backpack, but I am a fan of sustainable products and it comes with a [lifetime guarantee](https://www.goruck.com/scars-lifetime-guarantee/), plus it's the best backpack I've ever owned.
- I carry a [Sterkmann Tech Pouch](https://www.amazon.com/Sterkmann-Electronic-Organizer-Gadgets-Accessories/dp/B07S914SSC/ref=sr_1_5) in my backpack to hold my chargers, cables, batteries, and mouse on the go. It's amazing how much you can fit in the pouch while still keeping everything organized.
- I carry a [ZMI PowerPack 20000](https://www.zmiusa.com/products/20000-mah-duplex-quick-charge-portable-power-bank-battery-charger) for keeping my MacBook and other devices charged on the go.
- I'm an amateur photographer and I carry a [Sony a6000](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Digitial-3-0-Inch-16-50mm/dp/B00I8BICB2) mirrorless camera when hiking or exploring a new city. I also have an [Insta360 One X](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-onex) that I use for recording myself during action sports.
